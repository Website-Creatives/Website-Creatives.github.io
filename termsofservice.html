							<p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Agreement", "Terms of Service") carefully before commencing any agreements, contracts or work with Website Creatives.</p>

							<p>Website Creatives ("us", "we", or "our") refers to Website Creatives and its owner, employees and freelancers contracted by Website Creatives. The Client ("you”, “yours” or “they”) refers to the company, individual or party receiving the services by Website Creatives. This Agreement sets forth the legally binding terms of service.</p>

							<p>Any variation or alteration of these Terms of Service shall not be valid unless approved in writing by a representative of Website Creatives directly with the Client.</p>

							<p>Website Creatives may vary these Terms of Service from time to time as they deem necessary, but any changes so made will not affect any existing contract between The Client and Website Creatives. Website Creatives will notify The Client via email where any modifications have been made.</p>


							<p><strong>1. WEBSITE DESIGN AND BUILD SERVICES</strong></p>
							<p>1.1. Initial consultation of work will be free of charge to The Client. This may include basic outlines of design, website structure including number of pages and back-end admin pages, layout, type of software/tools needed, timescale of work, SEO improvements and guidelines. These are subject to change before any work on the project has started.</p>

							<p>1.2. Work will only commence once a written agreement of the details of work and billing amount (via paper or email) has been confirmed by The Client and Website Creatives. This includes a timescale/deadline, and a total fixed amount or an hourly rate for payment.</p>

							<p><strong>2. Payment</strong></p>
							<p>2.1. A deposit of 50% must be made to Website Creatives by The Client before any work by Website Creatives is commenced. Any other amount must be agreed by both Website Creatives and The Client. Website Creatives must have a good relationship with The Client prior to any work started for assurances of payment where the deposit is to be set less than 50%. This payment is non-refundable.</p>
							<p>2.2. Final 50% payment must be paid before launch of finalised work. These terms must be agreed upon before work is commenced.</p>
							<p>2.3. Any further updates given to Website Creatives from The Client during this period may result in an extended deadline and further charges.</p>
							<p>2.4. All payment must be received promptly and within the allocated dates. Any delays in payment may result in an extension of deadlines. Website Creatives accepts no responsibility for delayed work and deadlines where The Client has missed or delayed a payment deadline.</p>
							<p>2.5. If the project is cancelled by The Client before the project is 100% complete, The Client must pay the remaining amount owed up to the completed percentage. For example, if the project is 80% complete, The Client must pay 80% of the remaining amount owed.</p>
							<p>2.6. Website Creatives does not charge V.A.T.</p>
							<p>2.7. The standard rate for work completed is charged per hour at £25 an hour. Any website and content edits will be charged at the standard rate a minimum of one hour.</p>

							<p><strong>4. Revisions</strong></p>
							<p>4.1. Website Creatives will send updates on the project for The Client to oversee and check. The Client can return revisions on the project, however delays to the project deadline may be as a result of the revisions. If The Client makes revisions where the project will run over the deadline, The Client will have to pay for the extra work at the standard hourly rate as outline in the initial agreement. Website Creatives does factor in an approximate revision time for the overall project deadline.</p>
							<p>4.2. The Client can send up to two revisions per update.</p>

							<p><strong>5. Search Engine Optimisation - SEO</strong></p>
							<p>5.1. Each site is built with compliant and up-to-date standards of SEO. This does not guarantee page one rankings in Google, Bing or other search engines.

							<p><strong>6. Refunds</strong></p>
							<p>6.1. If The Client is unhappy and would like a refund they are to contact Website Creatives as soon as possible who will seek to rectify the issues where applicable.
